                    <span>Patrick Brien</span> is a designer currently working 
                    for <a href= "https://www.loveandmoney.agency/" target="_blank"> Love + Money.</a> He 
                    spends most of his time working on 1 x graphic designs but does also do other shit. Although he likes simple, 
                    minimal typography he understands that a website can not only be a paragraph and so he is working to change this. 
                    In the meantime you can contact him at <a href="mailto:hello@patrickbrien.com.au">hello@patrickbrien.com.au</a> or
